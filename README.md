# LocalAudioWall
A single simple page that takes audio files and lists them to make an audio list with all tracks able to play in parallel. No upload anywhere. All local in your browser.

There's not many bells or whistles. This was just a little experiment to build the most lightweight tool for this without using external dependencies.

Pull requests to improve or add functionalities are welcome.

One of the main missing thing is a loading indicator while the browser reads the files.

# Minimalism
The whole code of the slideshow page is less than 5KB or just 100 lines of pure html + CSS + JS.
